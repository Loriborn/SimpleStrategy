# SimpleStrategy

Developed with Unreal Engine 4.27

This is a showcase project for a procgen hex networked strategy game.

Right Mouse - pan
Mouse Wheel - rotate
Left Mouse - spawn pathfinding test unit

Currently, testing networked generation and unit pathfinding must be done via editor as no UI is implemented to allow session joining.
